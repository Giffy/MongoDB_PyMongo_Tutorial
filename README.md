Introduction to MongoDB and tutorial to access to database with Python using PyMongo

To run a MongoDB server in Google Colab: open [1_Run_MongoDB_in_colab.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Giffy/MongoDB_PyMongo_Tutorial/blob/master/1_Run_MongoDB_in_colab.ipynb) and keep running the server.

Part1 : Open Notebook [1_1_First_steps_with_MongoDB_PyMongo.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Giffy/MongoDB_PyMongo_Tutorial/blob/master/1_1_First_steps_with_MongoDB_PyMongo.ipynb) to learn:

    Connection to Mongo
    Basic database, collection management
    CRUD one document

    How to connect to MongoDB
    How to import data
    Query with a filter

Part2 : Open Notebook [2_Basic_PyMongo_guide.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Giffy/MongoDB_PyMongo_Tutorial/blob/master/2_Basic_PyMongo_guide.ipynb) to learn:

    CRUD part 2
